Subject: [PATCH] mm: hwpoison: use do_send_sig_info() instead of force_sig()

References: git fixes (mm/hwpoison)
Patch-mainline: v5.0
Git-commit: 6376360ecbe525a9c17b3d081dfd88ba3e4ed65b

Currently memory_failure() is racy against process's exiting, which
results in kernel crash by null pointer dereference.

The root cause is that memory_failure() uses force_sig() to forcibly
kill asynchronous (meaning not in the current context) processes.  As
discussed in thread https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/6/8/236 years ago for OOM
fixes, this is not a right thing to do.  OOM solves this issue by using
do_send_sig_info() as done in commit d2d393099de2 ("signal:
oom_kill_task: use SEND_SIG_FORCED instead of force_sig()"), so this
patch is suggesting to do the same for hwpoison.  do_send_sig_info()
properly accesses to siglock with lock_task_sighand(), so is free from
the reported race.

I confirmed that the reported bug reproduces with inserting some delay
in kill_procs(), and it never reproduces with this patch.

Note that memory_failure() can send another type of signal using
force_sig_mceerr(), and the reported race shouldn't happen on it because
force_sig_mceerr() is called only for synchronous processes (i.e.
BUS_MCEERR_AR happens only when some process accesses to the corrupted
memory.)
