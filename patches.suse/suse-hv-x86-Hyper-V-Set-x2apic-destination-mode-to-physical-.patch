Subject: x86/Hyper-V: Set x2apic destination mode to physical when x2apic is available

Hyper-V doesn't provide irq remapping for IO-APIC. To enable x2apic,
set x2apic destination mode to physcial mode when x2apic is available
and Hyper-V IOMMU driver makes sure cpus assigned with IO-APIC irqs have
8-bit APIC id.
