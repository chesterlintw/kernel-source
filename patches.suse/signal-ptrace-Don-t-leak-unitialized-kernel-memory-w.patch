Subject: signal/ptrace: Don't leak unitialized kernel memory with
 PTRACE_PEEK_SIGINFO
Git-commit: f6e2aa91a46d2bc79fce9b93a988dbe7655c90c0
Patch-mainline: 5.2-rc5
References: git-fixes

Recently syzbot in conjunction with KMSAN reported that
ptrace_peek_siginfo can copy an uninitialized siginfo to userspace.
Inspecting ptrace_peek_siginfo confirms this.

The problem is that off when initialized from args.off can be
initialized to a negaive value.  At which point the "if (off >= 0)"
test to see if off became negative fails because off started off
negative.

Prevent the core problem by adding a variable found that is only true
if a siginfo is found and copied to a temporary in preparation for
being copied to userspace.

Prevent args.off from being truncated when being assigned to off by
testing that off is <= the maximum possible value of off.  Convert off
to an unsigned long so that we should not have to truncate args.off,
we have well defined overflow behavior so if we add another check we
won't risk fighting undefined compiler behavior, and so that we have a
type whose maximum value is easy to test for.
