Subject: [PATCH 02/17] rbtree: optimize root-check during rebalancing loop
Git-commit: 2aadf7fc7df9e70c99786ffb8452ccdd83d49e59
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: bsc#1052639 

The only times the nil-parent (root node) condition is true is when the
node is the first in the tree, or after fixing rbtree rule #4 and the case
1 rebalancing made the node the root.  Such conditions do not apply most
of the time:

(i) The common case in an rbtree is to have more than a single node,
    so this is only true for the first rb_insert().

(ii) While there is a chance only one first rotation is needed, cases
    where the node's uncle is black (cases 2,3) are more common as we can
    have the following scenarios during the rotation looping:

    case1 only, case1+1, case2+3, case1+2+3, case3 only, etc.

This patch, therefore, adds an unlikely() optimization to this
conditional.  When profiling with CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES, a
kernel build shows that the incorrect rate is less than 15%, and for
workloads that involve insert mostly trees overtime tend to have less than
2% incorrect rate.
