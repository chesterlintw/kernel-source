Subject: mm/huge_memory.c: reorder operations in __split_huge_page_tail()
Git-commit: 605ca5ede7643a01f4c4a15913f9714ac297f8a6
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc1
References: VM Functionality bsc#1119962

THP split makes non-atomic change of tail page flags.  This is almost ok
because tail pages are locked and isolated but this breaks recent
changes in page locking: non-atomic operation could clear bit
PG_waiters.

As a result concurrent sequence get_page_unless_zero() -> lock_page()
might block forever.  Especially if this page was truncated later.

Fix is trivial: clone flags before unfreezing page reference counter.

This race exists since commit 62906027091f ("mm: add PageWaiters
indicating tasks are waiting for a page bit") while unsave unfreeze
itself was added in commit 8df651c7059e ("thp: cleanup
split_huge_page()").

clear_compound_head() also must be called before unfreezing page
reference because after successful get_page_unless_zero() might follow
put_page() which needs correct compound_head().

And replace page_ref_inc()/page_ref_add() with page_ref_unfreeze() which
is made especially for that and has semantic of smp_store_release().
