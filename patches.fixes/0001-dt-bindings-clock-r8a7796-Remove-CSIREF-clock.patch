Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: clock: r8a7796: Remove CSIREF clock
Git-commit: 4584738e139ce51c3c89ff5491bf6bc65fb0db69
Patch-mainline: v5.0
References: bsc#1120902

The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.52 (Nov 30, 2016)
removed the CSI reference clock on R-Car M3-W.

As this definition was never used, it can just be removed.
The freed slot in the DT bindings header must not be reused, though.
