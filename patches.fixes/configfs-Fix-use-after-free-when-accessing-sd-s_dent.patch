Subject: [PATCH] configfs: Fix use-after-free when accessing sd->s_dentry
Git-commit: f6122ed2a4f9c9c1c073ddf6308d1b2ac10e0781
Patch-mainline: v5.2-rc3
References: bsc#1051510

In the vfs_statx() context, during path lookup, the dentry gets
added to sd->s_dentry via configfs_attach_attr(). In the end,
vfs_statx() kills the dentry by calling path_put(), which invokes
configfs_d_iput(). Ideally, this dentry must be removed from
sd->s_dentry but it doesn't if the sd->s_count >= 3. As a result,
sd->s_dentry is holding reference to a stale dentry pointer whose
memory is already freed up. This results in use-after-free issue,
when this stale sd->s_dentry is accessed later in
configfs_readdir() path.

This issue can be easily reproduced, by running the LTP test case -
sh fs_racer_file_list.sh /config
(https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/testcases/kernel/fs/racer/fs_racer_file_list.sh)
