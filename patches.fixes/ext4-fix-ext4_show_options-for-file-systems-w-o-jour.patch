Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix ext4_show_options for file systems w/o journal
Git-commit: 50b29d8f033a7c88c5bc011abc2068b1691ab755
Patch-mainline: v5.2-rc1
References: bsc#1135316

Instead of removing EXT4_MOUNT_JOURNAL_CHECKSUM from s_def_mount_opt as
I assume was intended, all other options were blown away leading to
_ext4_show_options() output being incorrect.

Fixes: 1e381f60dad9 ("ext4: do not allow journal_opts for fs w/o journal")
