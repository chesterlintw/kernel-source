Subject: [PATCH] UAS: fix alignment of scatter/gather segments
Git-commit: 3ae62a42090f1ed48e2313ed256a1182a85fb575
Patch-mainline: v5.1
References: bsc#1129770

This is the UAS version of

747668dbc061b3e62bc1982767a3a1f9815fcf0e
usb-storage: Set virt_boundary_mask to avoid SG overflows

We are not as likely to be vulnerable as storage, as it is unlikelier
that UAS is run over a controller without native support for SG,
but the issue exists.
The issue has been existing since the inception of the driver.
