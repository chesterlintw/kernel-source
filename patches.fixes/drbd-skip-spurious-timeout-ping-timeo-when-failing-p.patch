Subject: [PATCH] drbd: skip spurious timeout (ping-timeo) when failing promote
Git-commit: 9848b6ddd8c92305252f94592c5e278574e7a6ac
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

If you try to promote a Secondary while connected to a Primary
and allow-two-primaries is NOT set, we will wait for "ping-timeout"
to give this node a chance to detect a dead primary,
in case the cluster manager noticed faster than we did.

But if we then are *still* connected to a Primary,
we fail (after an additional timeout of ping-timout).

This change skips the spurious second timeout.

Most people won't notice really,
since "ping-timeout" by default is half a second.

But in some installations, ping-timeout may be 10 or 20 seconds or more,
and spuriously delaying the error return becomes annoying.
