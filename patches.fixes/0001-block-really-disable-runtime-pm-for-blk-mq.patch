Subject: [PATCH] block: really disable runtime-pm for blk-mq
Git-commit: b233f127042dba991229e3882c6217c80492f6ef
References: Git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1

Runtime PM isn't ready for blk-mq yet, and commit 765e40b675a9 ("block:
disable runtime-pm for blk-mq") tried to disable it. Unfortunately,
it can't take effect in that way since user space still can switch
it on via 'echo auto > /sys/block/sdN/device/power/control'.

This patch disables runtime-pm for blk-mq really by pm_runtime_disable()
and fixes all kinds of PM related kernel crash.
