Subject: [PATCH] test_hexdump: use memcpy instead of strncpy
Git-commit: b1286ed7158e9b62787508066283ab0b8850b518
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc5
References: bsc#1051510

New versions of gcc reasonably warn about the odd pattern of

	strncpy(p, q, strlen(q));

which really doesn't make sense: the strncpy() ends up being just a slow
and odd way to write memcpy() in this case.

Apparently there was a patch for this floating around earlier, but it
got lost.
