Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Stop multiple tasks from moving to the CPU at the
 same time kabi

References: bnc#1101669 optimise numa balancing for fast migrate
Patch-mainline: never, kabi

This should be safe as no module should ever be accessing struct rq or
have a copy of it.

[js] added by commit a4739eca4456e3d140cc656c5331d42b7465f91d.
