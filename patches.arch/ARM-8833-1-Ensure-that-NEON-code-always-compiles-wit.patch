Subject: [PATCH] ARM: 8833/1: Ensure that NEON code always compiles with Clang
Git-commit: de9c0d49d85dc563549972edc5589d195cd5e859
Patch-mainline: v5.1-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

While building arm32 allyesconfig, I ran into the following errors:

  arch/arm/lib/xor-neon.c:17:2: error: You should compile this file with
  '-mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon'

  In file included from lib/raid6/neon1.c:27:
  /home/nathan/cbl/prebuilt/lib/clang/8.0.0/include/arm_neon.h:28:2:
  error: "NEON support not enabled"

Building V=1 showed NEON_FLAGS getting passed along to Clang but
__ARM_NEON__ was not getting defined. Ultimately, it boils down to Clang
only defining __ARM_NEON__ when targeting armv7, rather than armv6k,
which is the '-march' value for allyesconfig.

>From lib/Basic/Targets/ARM.cpp in the Clang source:

  // This only gets set when Neon instructions are actually available, unlike
  // the VFP define, hence the soft float and arch check. This is subtly
  // different from gcc, we follow the intent which was that it should be set
  // when Neon instructions are actually available.
  if ((FPU & NeonFPU) && !SoftFloat && ArchVersion >= 7) {
    Builder.defineMacro("__ARM_NEON", "1");
    Builder.defineMacro("__ARM_NEON__");
    // current AArch32 NEON implementations do not support double-precision
    // floating-point even when it is present in VFP.
    Builder.defineMacro("__ARM_NEON_FP",
                        "0x" + Twine::utohexstr(HW_FP & ~HW_FP_DP));
  }

Ard Biesheuvel recommended explicitly adding '-march=armv7-a' at the
beginning of the NEON_FLAGS definitions so that __ARM_NEON__ always gets
definined by Clang. This doesn't functionally change anything because
that code will only run where NEON is supported, which is implicitly
armv7.

 Therefore, the recommended and only supported way of using NEON/VFP in the
 kernel is by adhering to the following rules:
 * isolate the NEON code in a separate compilation unit and compile it with
-  '-mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=softfp';
+  '-march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=softfp';
 * issue the calls to kernel_neon_begin(), kernel_neon_end() as well as the calls
