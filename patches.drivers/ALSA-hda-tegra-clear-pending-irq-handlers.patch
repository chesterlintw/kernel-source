Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/tegra: clear pending irq handlers
Git-commit: 63d2a9ec310d8bcc955574220d4631aa55c1a80c
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

Even after disabling interrupts on the module, it could be possible
that irq handlers are still running. System hang is seen during
suspend path. It was found that, there were pending writes on the
HDA bus and clock was disabled by that time.

Above mentioned issue is fixed by clearing any pending irq handlers
before disabling clocks and returning from hda suspend.
