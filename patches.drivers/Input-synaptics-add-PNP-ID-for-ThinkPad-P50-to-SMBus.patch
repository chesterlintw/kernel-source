Subject: [PATCH] Input: synaptics - add PNP ID for ThinkPad P50 to SMBus
Git-commit: 9df39bedbf292680655c6a947c77d6562c693d4a
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc6
References: bsc#1051510

Noticed the other day the trackpoint felt different on my P50, then
realized it was because rmi4 wasn't loading for this machine
automatically. Suspend/resume, hibernate, and everything else seem to
work perfectly fine on here.
